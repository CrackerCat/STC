// c_defer({ ... }): Adds ... code that be deferred in the current c_scope.

// c_return x: Call to return from current function inside an outermost
//   c_scope level. This calls all the defers added in opposite order of
//   definition before it returns x.
//
//   NB! c_return will only work correctly at the outermost c_scope level.
//   For nested c_scope levels, use 'continue;' to exit current c_scope. The
//   added defers will be called before it breaks out of the scope.
